# Instalation
This app requires python, so that one might get started into programming

Here is a quick tutorial on how to install python and run this app:
### Step 1:
Go to <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads">this</a> website and click the yellow download button.
### Step 2:
Open the exe you downloaded, and **check** the add python to path checkbox.
### Step 3:
Click on the Customize Installation, click next and check install python for all users
### Step 4:
Finally, click install. After it is done close that window and open a command prompt, and type the following: **python --version**. If you get the python version that means everything was succesful.
If you did not get it, then i suggest looking up how to fix python being not installed.

For this to work you will also need cmake and some visual studio tools,

Heres the quick tutorial:
### Step 1:
Go to <a href="https://cmake.org/download/">this</a> website and find the cmake installer which suites your system
### Step 2
Open the exe, click next accept the terms, click next make sure u add cmake to the path (i'd suggest for all users) and click next
### Step 3
Choose the installation path and click next and install.
### Step 4
After its done click finish and go to <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/">this</a> website and click download build tools (since we installing visual studio tools)
### Step 5
Open the exe you got click continue and wait for it to do some things
### Step 6
Once its done, check the Desktop develompent with C++ checkbox, and click install
### Step 7
This may take a while, so go outside to get some fresh air and when its done you can exit

(If you did not understand a single word of what i suggest, then i recommend looking up on youtube a better tutorial than this)

Now to use this program?

First of all go at the top of this page where it says Code, click on that and download the ZIP, (i hope you already have winrar or 7zp). Now extract it and open a command prompt and cd on the path where you extracted it.If its your first time run **pip install -r requirements.txt** and then run **python.exe Installer.py**. After you are done with the installation to run the main file run the command **python.exe MainFile.py**.(note that **python.exe MainFile.py** will be the command you'll need to run each time you want to open this program after installing everything)


# FAQ
Q: I found a bug what can i do

A: Add me on discord and send the full error (username: globbertot) 

--------------------------------
Q: I do not want/cant to take a screen shot of my photo for this program, is there a way i can skip that?

A: We do not store your face, it is stored in your own system (if you still do not want/are unable skipping face registration is going to be a feature soon). If you are facing issues with the face recognition just keep trying to adjust your angle or remove your heaset or glassess if wearing.

--------------------------------
Q: I do not know python and i want to use the commands feature, how can i get started

A: I'd recommend going to a website like <a href="https://www.learnpython.org/">this</a> and studying the basics, and then trying to make something of your own either with the commands feature or a simple python script, like a calculator.
